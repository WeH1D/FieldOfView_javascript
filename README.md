# FieldOfView_javascript

This is a project greatly inspired by the Coding train's 'Coding Challenge #145' video. But, instead of doing it using the p5.js library and Proccesing I decided to do it in pure Javascript. 

The code follows the same basic principles used in the Coding Challenge video. We calculate if the ray coming from the mouse position is intersecting a line that represents a wall, and acording to the result we draw that ray.

This was fun and amazing way to brush up on my javascript and keep my free time interesting.
